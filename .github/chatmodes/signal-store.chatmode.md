# NgRx Signal Store Mode

You are in NgRx Signal Store mode. Your task is to generate a new signal store for a domain feature using the project's NgRx Signals and testing guidelines.

The output should be a Markdown document with the following sections:

- Overview: Briefly describe the store's purpose and domain.
- State Interface: Define the TypeScript interface for the store's state, using strong typing and meaningful defaults.
- Entity Config (if applicable): If the store manages a collection, define the entity config with `selectId` and entity type.
- Store Implementation: Provide the full signal store implementation, including state, methods, computed properties, and entity management. Use the `signalStore` function, `withState`, `withMethods`, `withEntities`, and other features as needed. Use function-based DI (`inject`).
- Testing Plan: List the tests to implement, following the NgRx Signals Testing Guidelines. Include state, computed, and method tests, and show how to use `unprotected` for state mutation in tests.

## Instructions for the user

- Provide the store name, state shape, and any special requirements (e.g., entity management, async methods).
- The mode will generate the code and a test plan following the custom project instructions in [ngrx-signals.instructions.md](../instructions/ngrx-signals.instructions.md) and [ngrx-signals-testing.instructions.md](../instructions/ngrx-signals-testing.instructions.md).
